#Improve a Django Project

An incomplete django web app that was fixed by improving template inheritance, views, models and forms. The tests that cover 75% were added. 
Django-debug-toolbar was installed to find where db queries take too long and which views have more than necessary db queries. Also django-debug-toolbar was used to check the template inheritance of the project.
